[Single Video-all floors](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s43mbxyb0svda5v/10394489.MOV?dl=0)

__Listing Price__: $1,039,000  
__Lilliana's Price__: $850,000-$900,000

__Comments__: Lilliana thinks this is a quit flip job that is overpriced. While the rooms are light and the main floor is pretty good, lots of details are not finished. All the upstairs rooms are not well-thought out (weird shapes, vents positioning makes it hard to place beds, small bedrooms vs large bathrooms).

__Listing Price__: $989,500  
__Lilliana's Price__: start at $950,000

__Comments__: No parking space is main issue, but street does not go through on both sides, so there is very little traffic and there is always space available on street. I like the location a lot, very near good park and both the university and the restaurants and store on 53rd. .8 mile to Earl Shapiro Lab School and .7 to main Lab School. Lilliana said renovation was "meticolous". Very good landscaping.
